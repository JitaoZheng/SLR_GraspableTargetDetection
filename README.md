## Quick Start

### ROS Noetic

Open a new terminal window.

Type:

```
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
```
Clone the repository:
```
git clone <address>
```

Then we can build it:

```
cd ..

catkin_make
```
If you don't have yet installed Point Cloud Library (PCL), you can install it by typing:

```
sudo apt install libpcl-dev
```

We will first test the algorithm on some examples
